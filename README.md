# Word Cloud
***By Jun Smith***

## Brief
Generates a crude wordcloud image. Currently only reads in from "WarAndPeace-Tolstoy.txt" which soon hopefully will be user selectable. It can also read and parse URLs, but needs to be selected within the Runner class. Current limit of word cloud content is 50 for testing purposes.
